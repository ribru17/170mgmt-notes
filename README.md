Current market supply is low because many homeowners purchased homes at a very
low interest rate, and are reluctant to sell.

## Basic Legal Concepts

- **Real Estate:** Land and all things permanently attached to it.
- **Real Property:** Ownership rights associated with real estate.
- **Personal Property:** Movable things and intangibles.
- **Fixtures:** Personal property. Once attached to a building, they become a
  part of the real property.
- **Statute of Frauds:** Requires that almost every agreement relating to real
  property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law.
- **Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate:** Ownership, possessory, and use
  rights.
- **Easement:** A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land
  owned or leased by someone else. They are very limited in nature.
- **Leasehold Estate / Lease:** Real property can be leased by the landlord /
  lessor to the tenant / lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period
  of time. Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the
  Statute of Frauds.
- **Title:** Determines ownership of the real property and is evidenced by a
  deed.
- **Security Interests:** A borrower signs a mortgage (or a deed of trust) as
  the mortgage (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or
  beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the
  repayment of a loan.
- **Recording Act:** All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of
  claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of
  recorded items.
- **Abstract of Title:** Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents
  that affect title to real property.
- **Title Insurance:** Method of assuring title to real property used in
  California and all other states. Two kinds: Owner's Policy and Lender's Policy
  (can be `CLTA` or `ALTA`).
- **Mechanic's Lien:** May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and
  materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in
  California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the
  materials are supplied.

## Notes and Mortgages

- **Promissory Note:** Documents a loan between a borrower and a lender. Must
  include the parties, loan amount, interest rate, and maturity date. Usually
  includes clauses relating to amortization, assumability or "due on sale",
  recourse or non-recourse, repayment or lockout, assignment, default, and
  acceleration.
- **Mortgage:** A two-party security interest in real property to secure the
  repayment of a real estate loan that is given by a borrower / mortgagor to a
  lender / mortgagee.
- **Deed of Trust:** A three-party security interest in real property that is
  given by a borrower / trustor to an independent trustee to secure the
  repayment of a real estate loan for the benefit of a lender / beneficiary.
  Used in California and mos other states where it is available, because it is
  preferred over a two-party mortgage.
- **Senior vs. Junior Mortgage:** Determined by state recording statues that
  determine lender priority (unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a
  subordination clause).
- **Purchase money loan:** A loan made to a borrower to purchase real estate.
- **Construction loan:** A loan for the construction of a building or
  improvements. Loan draws are made against a maximum loan amount, are secured
  by a mortgage or deed of trust against the real property, usually with
  recourse to the developer.
  - _**Avoid lockout**_, always go for prepayment penalty (ideally no lockout
    and no prepayment penalty).
- **Default:** Failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the loan or
  mortgage. The most common mortgage default is the failure to pay interest and
  principle when due. Default can lead to acceleration of the loan and
  foreclosure of the property.
- **Foreclosure:** With a deed of trust, can be judicial (in court) or
  non-judicial (out of court) and involves a lender ultimately taking title to
  real property or forcing sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid mortgage
  balance. All junior mortgages are extinguished when a senior mortgage lender
  forecloses on a property, but the debt secured by those junior mortgages is
  generally unaffected by the foreclosure.
- **Deficiency Judgement:** Any loan balance remaining after a judicial
  foreclosure sale can become a personal judgement against the borrower if the
  loan is recourse. California law generally protects homeowners from a
  deficiency judgement.
- **Workouts and Extension Agreements:** Are usually preferred by lenders over
  foreclosure, and involve negotiations with the borrower to extend the maturity
  date
