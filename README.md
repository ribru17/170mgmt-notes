<!-- Lecture 1 -->

Current market supply is low because many homeowners purchased homes at a very
low interest rate, and are reluctant to sell.

## Basic Legal Concepts

- **Real Estate:** Land and all things permanently attached to it.
- **Real Property:** Ownership rights associated with real estate.
- **Personal Property:** Movable things and intangibles.
- **Fixtures:** Personal property. Once attached to a building, they become a
  part of the real property.
- **Statute of Frauds:** Requires that almost every agreement relating to real
  property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law.
- **Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate:** Ownership, possessory, and use
  rights.
- **Easement:** A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land
  owned or leased by someone else. They are very limited in nature.
- **Leasehold Estate / Lease:** Real property can be leased by the landlord /
  lessor to the tenant / lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period
  of time. Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the
  Statute of Frauds.
- **Title:** Determines ownership of the real property and is evidenced by a
  deed.
- **Security Interests:** A borrower signs a mortgage (or a deed of trust) as
  the mortgage (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or
  beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the
  repayment of a loan.
- **Recording Act:** All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of
  claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of
  recorded items.
- **Abstract of Title:** Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents
  that affect title to real property.
- **Title Insurance:** Method of assuring title to real property used in
  California and all other states. Two kinds: Owner's Policy and Lender's Policy
  (can be `CLTA` or `ALTA`).
- **Mechanic's Lien:** May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and
  materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in
  California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the
  materials are supplied.

## Notes and Mortgages

- **Promissory Note**
  - Documents a **loan** between a **borrower** and a **lender**. Must include
    the **parties**, **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **maturity date**.
    Usually includes clauses relating to **amortization**, **assumability** or
    **"due on sale"**, **recourse** or **non-recourse,** **repayment** or
    **lockout**, **assignment**, **default**, and **acceleration.**
- **Mortgage**
  - A two-party **security interest** in **real property** to secure the
    repayment of a **real estate loan** that is given by a **borrower /
    mortgagor** to a **lender / mortgagee**.
- **Deed of Trust**
  - A three-party **security interest** in **real property** that is given by a
    **borrower / trustor** to an independent **trustee** to secure the repayment
    of a **real estate loan** for the benefit of a **lender / beneficiary**.
    Used in California and mos other states where it is available, because it is
    preferred over a two-party **mortgage**.
- **Senior vs. Junior Mortgage**:
  - Determined by state **recording** statues that determine lender **priority**
    (unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a **subordination clause**).
- **Purchase money loan**
  - A **loan** made to a **borrower** to purchase **real estate**.
- **Construction loan**
  - A **loan** for the **construction** of a **building** or **improvements**.
    **Loan** draws are made against a **maximum loan amount**, are secured by a
    **mortgage** or **deed of trust** against the **real property**, usually
    with **recourse** to the developer.
    - _**NOTE! Avoid lockout**_, always go for prepayment penalty (ideally no
      lockout and no prepayment penalty).
- **Default**
  - Failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the **loan** or
    **mortgage**. The most common **mortgage default** is the failure to pay
    **interest** and **principle** when due. **Default** can lead to
    **acceleration** of the **loan** and **foreclosure** of the **property**.
- **Foreclosure**
  - With a deed of trust, can be **judicial** (in court) or **non-judicial**
    (out of court) and involves a **lender** ultimately taking **title** to
    **real property** or forcing **sale** of the **property** to satisfy the
    unpaid **mortgage** balance. All **junior mortgages** are extinguished when
    a **senior mortgage lender** forecloses on a **property**, but the **debt**
    secured by those **junior mortgages** is generally unaffected by the
    foreclosure.
- **Deficiency Judgement**
  - Any **loan balance** remaining after a **judicial foreclosure sale** can
    become a **personal judgement** against the **borrower** if the loan is
    **recourse**. California law generally protects homeowners from a
    **deficiency judgement**.
- **Workouts and Extension Agreements**
  - Are usually preferred by **lenders** over **foreclosure**, and involve
    **negotiations** with the **borrower** to extend the **maturity date**, to
    increase the **amortization period**, or to temporarily reduce the
    **mortgage payments**, rather than permanently lowering the **interest
    rate** or reducing the **loan balance**.
- **Short Sale**
  - When a **lender** allows the **sale** of a **property** for less than the
    outstanding **loan balance**, typically without requiring the **borrower**
    to pay the shortfall.
- **Bankruptcy**
  - **Chapter 7** (liquidation) and **Chapter 11** (reorganization of a
    business)

## Time Value of Money

- **Compounding Interest**
  - $(1+i)^{n}$ where $i$ is the periodic **interest rate** and $n$ is the
    number of **compounded periods**.
- **Compounding**
  - Approach to taking a **present value** to a **future value**.
    - $\text{Future Value (FV)} = \text{Present Value}\cdot (1+i)^{n}$
- **Discounting**
  - Approach to taking a **future value** back to a **present value**.
    - $\text{Present Value (PV)} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1+i)^{n}}$
- **Annuities (PMT)**
  - **Investments** with constant future **periodic payments**.
- **Interest Rate (i), Effective Yield, Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
  - Various measures of the return on capital or the cost of capital.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**
  - The **present value** of all **projected future cash flows** discounted at a
    specific **discount rate**, less the cost of the **investment**.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
  - The calculated **discount rate** at which the **present value** of all
    **projected future cash flows** is equal to the cost of the **investment**.
- **Risk**
  - Is essential to evaluate in order to determine whether the expected
    **investment return** is sufficient in light of the perceived **risk**.

## Fixed Interest Rate Mortgage Loans

- **Capital Markets**
  - **Financial** and **securities markets**, including the **mortgage market**.
- **Loan Availability**
  - **Economic growth** prospects (global, national, and local), expected
    **inflation**, and other **risks** all affect the supply and cost of
    **mortgage** funds.
- **Lenders as Intermediaries**
  - Most **real estate lenders** sell the **loans** they **originate** into the
    **secondary mortgage market** rather than holding the **loans** to
    **maturity**.
- **Loan Pricing**
  - The **interest rate**, any **fees**, **points**, and **costs** charged by
    the **lender**, and the **loan terms** (including any **prepayment
    penalties**).
    - **Points** are a percent of the loan amount you can pay upfront in
      exchange for paying less interest over time.
- **Real Interest Rate**
  - The nominal or contract **interest rate** minus expected **inflation**.
- **Risk Adjusted Return**
  - Expected investment **return** relative to the perceived **risk**.
- **Amortization:** The process of **repaying** the **principal balance** of a
  **loan** over time.
