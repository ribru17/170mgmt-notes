<!-- Lecture 1 -->

Current market supply is low because many homeowners purchased homes at a very
low interest rate, and are reluctant to sell.

## Basic Legal Concepts

- **Real Estate:** Land and all things permanently attached to it.
- **Real Property:** Ownership rights associated with real estate.
- **Personal Property:** Movable things and intangibles.
- **Fixtures:** Personal property. Once attached to a building, they become a
  part of the real property.
- **Statute of Frauds:** Requires that almost every agreement relating to real
  property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law.
- **Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate:** Ownership, possessory, and use
  rights.
- **Easement:** A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land
  owned or leased by someone else. They are very limited in nature.
- **Leasehold Estate / Lease:** Real property can be leased by the landlord /
  lessor to the tenant / lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period
  of time. Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the
  Statute of Frauds.
- **Title:** Determines ownership of the real property and is evidenced by a
  deed.
- **Security Interests:** A borrower signs a mortgage (or a deed of trust) as
  the mortgage (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or
  beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the
  repayment of a loan.
- **Recording Act:** All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of
  claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of
  recorded items.
- **Abstract of Title:** Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents
  that affect title to real property.
- **Title Insurance:** Method of assuring title to real property used in
  California and all other states. Two kinds: Owner's Policy and Lender's Policy
  (can be `CLTA` or `ALTA`).
- **Mechanic's Lien:** May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and
  materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in
  California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the
  materials are supplied.

## Notes and Mortgages

- **Promissory Note**
  - Documents a **loan** between a **borrower** and a **lender**. Must include
    the **parties**, **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **maturity date**.
    Usually includes clauses relating to **amortization**, **assumability** or
    **"due on sale"**, **recourse** or **non-recourse,** **repayment** or
    **lockout**, **assignment**, **default**, and **acceleration.**
- **Mortgage**
  - A two-party **security interest** in **real property** to secure the
    repayment of a **real estate loan** that is given by a **borrower /
    mortgagor** to a **lender / mortgagee**.
- **Deed of Trust**
  - A three-party **security interest** in **real property** that is given by a
    **borrower / trustor** to an independent **trustee** to secure the repayment
    of a **real estate loan** for the benefit of a **lender / beneficiary**.
    Used in California and most other states where it is available, because it
    is preferred over a two-party **mortgage**.
- **Senior vs. Junior Mortgage**:
  - Determined by state **recording** statues that determine lender **priority**
    (unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a **subordination clause**).
- **Purchase money loan**
  - A **loan** made to a **borrower** to purchase **real estate**.
- **Construction loan**
  - A **loan** for the **construction** of a **building** or **improvements**.
    **Loan** draws are made against a **maximum loan amount**, are secured by a
    **mortgage** or **deed of trust** against the **real property**, usually
    with **recourse** to the developer.
    - _**NOTE! Avoid lockout**_, always go for prepayment penalty (ideally no
      lockout and no prepayment penalty).
- **Default**
  - Failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the **loan** or
    **mortgage**. The most common **mortgage default** is the failure to pay
    **interest** and **principal** when due. **Default** can lead to
    **acceleration** of the **loan** and **foreclosure** of the **property**.
- **Foreclosure**
  - With a deed of trust, can be **judicial** (in court) or **non-judicial**
    (out of court) and involves a **lender** ultimately taking **title** to
    **real property** or forcing **sale** of the **property** to satisfy the
    unpaid **mortgage** balance. All **junior mortgages** are extinguished when
    a **senior mortgage lender** forecloses on a **property**, but the **debt**
    secured by those **junior mortgages** is generally unaffected by the
    foreclosure.
- **Deficiency Judgement**
  - Any **loan balance** remaining after a **judicial foreclosure sale** can
    become a **personal judgement** against the **borrower** if the loan is
    **recourse**. California law generally protects homeowners from a
    **deficiency judgement**.
- **Workouts and Extension Agreements**
  - Are usually preferred by **lenders** over **foreclosure**, and involve
    **negotiations** with the **borrower** to extend the **maturity date**, to
    increase the **amortization period**, or to temporarily reduce the
    **mortgage payments**, rather than permanently lowering the **interest
    rate** or reducing the **loan balance**.
- **Short Sale**
  - When a **lender** allows the **sale** of a **property** for less than the
    outstanding **loan balance**, typically without requiring the **borrower**
    to pay the shortfall.
- **Bankruptcy**
  - **Chapter 7** (liquidation) and **Chapter 11** (reorganization of a
    business)

<!-- Lecture 3 -->

## Time Value of Money

- **Compounding Interest**
  - $(1+i)^{n}$ where $i$ is the periodic **interest rate** and $n$ is the
    number of **compounded periods**.
- **Compounding**
  - Approach to taking a **present value** to a **future value**.
    - $\text{Future Value (FV)} = \text{Present Value}\cdot (1+i)^{n}$
- **Discounting**
  - Approach to taking a **future value** back to a **present value**.
    - $\text{Present Value (PV)} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1+i)^{n}}$
- **Annuities (PMT)**
  - **Investments** with constant future **periodic payments**.
- **Interest Rate (i), Effective Yield, Internal Rate of Return (`IRR`)**
  - Various measures of the return on capital or the cost of capital.
- **Net Present Value (`NPV`)**
  - The **present value** of all **projected future cash flows** discounted at a
    specific **discount rate**, less the cost of the **investment**.
- **Internal Rate of Return (`IRR`)**
  - The calculated **discount rate** at which the **present value** of all
    **projected future cash flows** is equal to the cost of the **investment**.
- **Risk**
  - Is essential to evaluate in order to determine whether the expected
    **investment return** is sufficient in light of the perceived **risk**.

## Fixed Interest Rate Mortgage Loans

- **Capital Markets**
  - **Financial** and **securities markets**, including the **mortgage market**.
- **Loan Availability**
  - **Economic growth** prospects (global, national, and local), expected
    **inflation**, and other **risks** all affect the supply and cost of
    **mortgage** funds.
- **Lenders as Intermediaries**
  - Most **real estate lenders** sell the **loans** they **originate** into the
    **secondary mortgage market** rather than holding the **loans** to
    **maturity**.
- **Loan Pricing**
  - The **interest rate**, any **fees**, **points**, and **costs** charged by
    the **lender**, and the **loan terms** (including any **prepayment
    penalties**).
    - **Points** are a percent of the loan amount you can pay upfront in
      exchange for paying less interest over time.
- **Real Interest Rate**
  - The nominal or contract **interest rate** minus expected **inflation**.
- **Risk Adjusted Return**
  - Expected investment **return** relative to the perceived **risk**.
- **Amortization:** The process of **repaying** the **principal balance** of a
  **loan** over time.
- **Balloon Payment** <!-- Lecture 4 -->
  - The **principal balance** of the **loan** due on the **maturity date**.
- **Pay Rate vs. Accrual Rate**
  - Is the actual monthly mortgage **payment** that is made by a **borrower** at
    least equal to the **accrued interest** amount then due on the **loan**?
- **Constant Payment Mortgage**
  - When each monthly **payment** is the same, the **loan** will be **fully
    amortizing**, **partially amortizing**, **interest only**, or **negative
    amortizing**.
- **Constant Amortization Mortgage**
  - When each **payment** includes a fixed amount of **principal** repayment,
    with the monthly **payment** and **interest** amounts declining.
- **Reverse Annuity Mortgage**
  - The **lender** sends fixed monthly checks to the **borrower** who must pay
    the accumulated **principal** and accrued **interest** on the **maturity
    date**.
- **Loan Fees and Costs**
  - **Origination fees** (for loan underwriting and processing), **appraisal**
    and **credit report**. **Loan fees** and **points** increase the **lender's
    yield**.
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**
  - Provides **disclosure** regarding the effects of **loan fees**, **points**,
    and **costs** on **residential loans** (assumes the **loan** is held to
    **maturity**).
- **Truth-in-Lending Act**
  - **Federal Reserve Regulation Z** requires **lenders** to include in **APR**
    calculations all **loan fees**, **points**, and **costs**, but not any
    **prepayment penalties**.
- **Prepayment Penalties**
  - Increase the **effective yield** to the **lender**, are subject to
    **negotiation**, and are not reflected in the **APR** of a loan. If a
    **prepayment penalty** is paid, the **effective yield** to the **lender**
    will be higher if the **loan** is repaid earlier.
- **Effective Annual Interest Rate**
  - **Calculation** that considers all **loan fees**, **points**, and **costs**
    and any **prepayment penalties** actually paid, and is therefore affected by
    the amount of **time** the **loan** is held until **repayment**.

<!-- Lecture 5 -->

## Adjustable / Floating Rate Mortgage Loans

- **Interest Rates Changes**
  - **Indexed** to other market **interest rates** (plus a **margin**).
- **Index**
  - **SOFT** (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is replacing **LIBOR** (London
    Interbank Offered Rate), **US Treasuries**, **`COFI`** (eleventh district
    Cost of Funds Index), **Prime**. The **index** can be overnight, six months,
    one year, or another interest rate series.
- **Margin**
  - **Lender's profit margin** or spread (fixed for the loan term) over the
    index.
- **Composite Rate**
  - The **index + margin** is the **composite interest rate** on the **loan**.
- **Reset Dates**
  - When the **interest rate changes** (usually every six months or one year).
- **Caps and Floors**
  - **Caps** are the **maximum** and **floors** are the **minimum** allowed for
    **periodic** and/or **lifetime** adjustments of the **interest rate** or
    **loan payment** amount.
- **Loan Terms**
  - Are generally the same terms as with the **fixed rate loans**, other than
    the interest rate changes, and include **assumable** or "**due on sale**",
    **recourse** or **non-recourse,** **prepayment** or **lockout,**
    **assignment,** **default,** and **acceleration.**
- **Loan Fees and Costs**
  - As with **fixed rate loans**, **origination fees**, **points**, and
    **costs** may be charged to the **borrower** to increase the **effective
    yield** to the **lender**.
- **Interest Only or Amortizing**
  - As with **fixed rate loans**, **`ARM`s** are usually **fully amortizing**,
    but can also be written as **interest only** or **partially amortizing**.
- **Negative Amortization**
  - If the **loan payment** required is less than the amount of **accrued
    interest** then due on the **loan** because of a **payment cap**, there will
    be **negative amortization**. **Interest rate caps** do not cause **negative
    amortization**.
- **Teaser Rate**
  - Initial **interest rate** on the **loan**, often far below the **composite
    rate**.
- **Payment Shock**
  - When the **interest rate** fully adjusts to the current **composite rate**,
    the new **loan payment** amount is often substantially higher than the
    **teaser rate**.
- **Interest Rate Risk**
  - Because **ARM interest rates** adjust **periodically**, **interest rate
    risk** is higher for the **borrower** and lower for the **lender**. The
    shorter the time interval between **reset dates**, the higher the **risk**
    for the **borrower** and lower for the **lender**.
- **Default Risk**
  - Because the **interest rate** adjusts **periodically**, the potential for
    future **rate** increases elevates the **risk** of a **default** by the
    **borrower** leading to **foreclosure**.
- **Hybrid `ARM`s**
  - **3/1**, **5/1**, **7/1**, or **10/1** are **fixed rate loans** for the
    first 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, then become **adjustable rate loans** with
    annual **interest rate reset dates**.
- **Conversion Option**
  - The right of the **borrower** to convert the **loan** from an **ARM** to a
    **fixed rate loan** at a specified future date, usually with a **fee** paid
    to the **lender**.

## Mortgages: Additional Concepts

- **Loan-to-Value Ratio (`LTV`)**
  - **Mortgage debt** divided by **property value** (or **price**).
  - Lower `LTV` means less risk for borrowers _and_ lenders.
- **Market Value of a Loan**
  - The **present value** of all expected future **loan payments** (i.e. all
    expected future payments of **principal** and **interest**).
- **Incremental Borrowing Cost**
  - The **marginal cost** of the additional amount **borrowed**, taking into
    consideration the **interest rate** and other **loan fees**, **points**, and
    **costs**.
- **Home Equity Line of Credit**
  - A **Home Equity Line of Credit** (`HELOC`) can be secured by a **first**,
    **second**, or more **junior mortgage** and is typically a revolving **line
    of credit**.
- **Buydown Loans**
  - When a **seller** pays a **fee** to a third-party **lender** to buy down the
    **interest rate** on a **purchase money loan** to induce the
    **buyer/borrower** to acquire the **real property**. The amount paid to buy
    down the **interest rate** will be much less than the **present value** of
    the reduced **loan payments** from the lower **interest rate**.
- **Below Market Seller Financing**
  - When the pricing of the **seller financing** (**interest rate** and **loan
    fees**, **points**, and **costs**) is less than the **market** pricing of
    available **financing**, often to improve the **sale price** of a
    **property** by a motivated **seller**.
- **Wraparound Loans**
  - Might be used by a **seller** in a slow housing market and when the
    **buyer** has poor credit to help sell a **property**. The **first
    mortgage** must stay in place, so it does not work if there is a **"due on
    sale"** clause in the **loan agreement**.

<!-- Lecture 6 -->

## Income Producing Properties - Leases

- **Commercial Properties**
  - Office, retail, apartment, industrial, hotel, mixed-use, ...
- **Supply and Demand Analysis**
  - Important for the **valuation** of **properties** and the projection of
    future **rent** and **occupancy** levels. **Global**, **national**,
    **regional**, and **local** factors affect the **value** of **properties**
    and **rent levels** for **commercial** space.
- **Location**
  - The most important factor in **real estate** because it is **location**
    specific.
- **Occupancy / Vacancy**
  - **Occupancy = 100% - Vacancy**. Driven by many factors, including **supply
    and demand**, **location**, **quality** (age, design, construction, etc.).
- **Lease Terms**
  - The parties (landlord/tenant or lessor/lessee), premises, term, base rent,
    CPI increases, or percentage rent, security deposit and/or guarantors,
    allowable uses, insurance, repairs and maintenance, damage or destruction,
    property taxes and other expenses, assignment and subletting, defaults and
    remedies, subordination, attornment and non-disturbance, signage, right of
    first refusal or expansion option on adjacent space, notices, governing law.
- **Rental Income**
  - **Flat base rent**, **step-up rent**, **CPI** or **indexed rent** with
    **caps and floors**, **percentage rent** with **overage rent** above a sales
    amount **breakpoint**.
- **Concessions**
  - **Free rent**, reduced **rent**, **tenant improvement** allowance (**TI**).
- **Property Expenses**
  - Gross leases (tenant pays no expenses), modified gross leases (e.g.
    electricity), triple net leases (tenant pays all operating expenses
    including property taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and
    utilities).
- **Expense Stop**
  - **Property expenses** per **rentable square foot** up to the **expense
    stop** will be paid by the **landlord** with **expenses** over that amount
    paid by the **tenant**.
- **Rentable vs. Usable Square Feet**
  - **Rentable square footage** is **usable square footage** plus the
    **tenant's** pro rata share of **building common areas** (including public
    areas, shared hallways, shared restrooms, public stairwells, elevator
    lobbies).
- **Load Factor**
  - **Rentable area** divided by **usable area** (a lower ratio is more
    efficient).
- **Parking**
  - Specific **parking spaces** can be assigned to a **tenant** or per thousand
    square feet of rented space. **Parking charges** can be added to the
    **rent** or included.
- **Office Leases**
  - Anchor tenants, signage, parking, expansion option, purchase option or right
    of first refusal, overloading, gross or net or expense stops.
- **Retail Leases**
  - **Anchor tenants**, **signage**, **parking**, **co-tenancy** clause,
    **exclusivity**, **radius** clause, **termination** or **kick-out** rights,
    **operating times**, and **CAM** charges.

<!-- Lecture 7 -->

**NOTE:** Borrowers always want loans to be non-recourse.

## Valuation of Income Properties/Appraisal

- **Market Value**
  - The **price** at which a willing **buyer** and a willing **seller**, each
    without undue pressure, would **buy** and **sell** a particular
    **property**, as of a particular **date**.
- **Appraised Value**
  - An estimate or **opinion** of **property value**, for a particular
    **purpose** as of a particular **date**, by a particular **appraiser**. The
    three primary appraisal methods are: **sales comparison**, **capitalization
    of income**, and **replacement cost**. Each of the three **appraisal
    methods** should, in theory, produce an similar **valuation**.
- **Sales Comparison (or Comparable Sales)**
  - Compares recent **sales** of highly **comparable properties** that are
    similar in **location**, **size**, **age**, **construction quality**, and
    other factors. This is generally the only method used for **residential
    properties**, and one of the three methods used to appraise **commercial
    properties**.
- **Capitalization of Income**
  - **Gross rent multiplier**, **capitalization** of **net operating income**,
    and **discounted present value (`DCF`)** of projected future annual
    **`NOI`**.
- **Gross Rent Multiplier**
  - **Annual rental income x gross rent multiplier = price** (or **value**). The
    **gross rent multiplier** must be derived from the **`GRM`s** on **sales**
    of **comparable properties**. This simple method is often used for valuing
    **apartments**.
- **Capitalization of `NOI`**
  - $\text{Cap Rate} = \text{NOI} \div \text{Price}$, so $\text{NOI} \div
    \text{Cap Rate} = \text{Price (or value)}$, and $\text{Cap Rate} \times
    \text{Price} = \text{NOI}$. The **capitalization rate** (aka **cap rate**)
    is derived from recent **sales** of **comparable properties** and is
    affected by **market** conditions. Falling **interest rates** will tend to
    lower **cap rates**, while rising **interest rates** will increase **cap
    rates**. An increase in **demand** relative to **supply** in the local
    **market** will lower **cap rates**, while an increase in **supply**
    relative to **demand** will raise **cap rates**.
- **Discounted Present Value (`DCF`)**
  - A 10-year cash flow model is typically created. The **discount rate** used
    (or required **internal rate of return**) is based on the buyer's assessment
    of the **risk** of achieving the projected future **`NOI`** and the
    projected future **sale price** relative to current alternative
    **investments** and **capital market** benchmarks.
- **Replacement Cost**
  - The sum of **land value** and **depreciated replacement cost** of the
    **improvements**. **Depreciation** of the **building** can come from
    **physical depreciation**, **functional obsolescence**, and **external
    obsolescence**. The **land value** is derived from a **comparable sales**
    analysis of similar **land** parcels. The **replacement cost** approach is
    more reliable when the **improvements** are relatively new.
- **Land Value**
  - A "**highest and best use**" analysis to determine the **value** of a
    particular **land** site, whether the **land** is **vacant** or
    **improved**. A particular **land** parcel might actually be worth more if
    the existing **improvements** are demolished and removed.

<!-- Lecture 8 -->

## Investment Analysis and Taxation of Income Properties

- **Investment Benefits**
  - **Cash flow** (after **taxes**), **price appreciation**,
    **diversification**.
- **Real Estate Cycle**
  - The **real estate** industry is **cyclical**, with periods of **growth** and
    periods of **decline** in **rents**, **occupancy**, and **property values**.
    The industry is very large and highly competitive, with many owners and
    limited concentration of ownership.
- **Investment Strategies**
  - **Risk/return** focus (**core**, **value-added**, or **opportunistic**),
    **property type** (e.g. **office**, **retail**, **apartments**, **hotels**),
    and/or **geographical** focus.
- **Market Analysis**
  - **Supply/demand** analysis for **property type** and **local market**, and
    local **absorption** projects to forecast future **occupancy rates** and
    **rent levels**.
- **Net Operating Income (`NOI`)**
  - **Rent** and other **property income** minus **operating expenses**.
    **`NOI`** is often **capitalized** to determine the **market value** of a
    **property**.
- **Leverage**
  - The use of **debt** to acquire or own **property**.
- **Loan to Value Ratio (`LTV`)**
  - **Mortgage balance** divided by **property value** (or **price**).
- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (`DSCR`)**
  - Annual **`NOI`** divided by **mortgage payments**. A higher **`DSCR`** shows
    a greater ability for the **borrower** to make **mortgage payments**.
- **Before Tax Cash Flow**
  - **`NOI`** minus **debt service** and **capital expenditures** (cap ex).
- **After Tax Cash Flow**
  - **Before tax cash flow** minus **taxes**. The **government** is your partner
    in every **investment** through its power to **tax** the annual **income**
    and **capital gains** from **sale**. **Federal**, **state**, **local**, and
    all other **taxes** must be considered.
- **Taxable Income**
  - **Net operating income** minus **interest** and **tax depreciation**.
- **Tax Depreciation**
  - The amount of the **purchase price** allocated to the **improvements**,
    exclusive of the **land**, is the **depreciable cost basis** of the
    **property**. The **depreciable cost basis** can be **amortized** as **tax
    depreciation** over **27.5 years** for **residential income properties** and
    **39 years** for **non-residential income properties**.
- **Mortgage Interest Deduction**
  - The **interest** portion of the monthly **P&I Payments** is fully **tax
    deductible** for **investment properties**. Limited for primary and
    secondary **homes** to the annual **interest** on a total of up to
    **\$750,000 of mortgage debt**.
- **Unleveraged Returns vs. Leveraged Returns**
  - The `IRR`, ROE, and Equity Multiple due to mortgage financing. The leveraged
    returns should generally be higher than the unleveraged returns to account
    for the additional risk from the use of leverage.

<!-- Lecture 9 -->

## Financial Leverage/Financing Alternatives

- **Financial Leverage**
  - Allows an **investor** to use less **equity** to acquire an **investment**,
    potentially achieve a higher **leveraged return** on **equity**, and benefit
    from the **tax deductibility** of a **mortgage interest**. **Investors** who
    desire a higher **leveraged return** on **equity** might borrow at a higher
    **`LTV`** ratio, but as the **`LTV`** increases, **risk** increases.
- **Positive and Negative Leverage**
  - **Positive leverage** is when the **return** on **equity** is **higher**
    with **debt** than without, and **negative leverage** is when the **return**
    on **equity** is **lower** with **debt** than without. With **positive
    leverage**, the **higher** the **`LTV`** ratio, the **higher** will be the
    **leveraged return** on **equity**. With **negative leverage**, the
    **higher** the **`LTV`** ratio, the **lower** will be the **leveraged
    return** on **equity**.
- **Loan Underwriting**
  - The **Loan-to-Value ratio (`LTV`)** and **debt service coverage ratio
    (`DSCR`)** are two of the key elements of a **loan underwriting**. Although
    the **maximum `LTV`** ratio and **minimum `DSCR`** levels vary with
    **mortgage market** conditions, **lenders** are always more secure with a
    lower **`LTV`** ratio and a higher **`DSCR`**.
- **Prepayment Penalties, Yield Maintenance, Loan Lockouts**
  - **Mortgage loan** terms that make it costly or impossible for a **borrower**
    to **payoff** or **refinance** a **loan** before the contract **maturity
    date**.
- **Interest-Only Loan**
  - **Borrower** pays only **interest** on the **loan**, with no **principal
    amortization**, and a **balloon payment** due at **maturity**. Also called a
    **"bullet loan"**.
- **Negative Amortizing Loan**
  - When the **payment rate** on a **loan** is less than the **accrual rate**
    (i.e. **interest** amount then due), there will be **negative amortization**
    and the **loan balance** will **increase**. Might be used when the
    **interest rates** are very high.
- **Participating Loan**
  - The **lender** receives additional **interest**, based on a formula,
    typically related to **gross income**, **`NOI`**, or **cash flow**, that is
    called a **participation** or **"equity kicker"** but the **lender** does
    not have any **ownership interest** in the **property**.
- **Convertible Mortgage**
  - When the **lender** has the right to **convert** part or all of the **loan
    principal** to an **ownership interest** in the **property** at a specified
    time.
- **Mezzanine Loan**
  - A **loan** that is often **secured** by the **owner's equity** in a
    **property**, rather than by a **mortgage** on the **property** itself.
    Usually requires an **inter-creditor agreement** between the **mezzanine
    lender** and the **first mortgage lender**.
- **Preferred Equity**
  - An **investment** in the **ownership interest** of a **property**, that is
    not a **mortgage**, with a **preferred return** that takes **priority** over
    other **equity investors**.
- **Sale-Leaseback**
  - An alternate means of **monetizing** a **property** where the **seller**
    retains **use** of the **property** for the duration of the **lease term**.
    With a **repurchase option** on in the **lease**, the **seller** may
    reacquire **ownership** of the **property** in the future.

<!-- Nothing noteworthy. -->

<!-- Midterm Notes -->

- An adjustable rate mortgage loan with a teaser start rate of 1.5% for the
  first loan year, an index of the 30-day `SOFR`, a margin of 2.0%, a periodic
  annual interest rate increase cap of 2% and a lifetime interest rate cap of
  8.5% with annual adjustments, would have a maximum interest rate of what for
  the fourth loan year if the 30-day `SOFR` is 4.5% at that time?
  - 6.5%
    - 3 adjustment periods, periodic rate is 7.5% but index with margin is 6.5%
- An adjustable rate mortgage loan with a teaser start rate of 1.0% for the
  first loan year, an index of the eleventh District `COFI` rate, a margin of
  2.0%, a periodic semi-annual interest rate increase cap of 1% and a lifetime
  interest rate cap of 7.0% with semi-annual adjustments, would have a maximum
  interest rate of what for the first half of the fourth loan year if the
  eleventh District `COFI` rate is 6.0% at that time?
  - 6.0%
    - 5 adjustment periods, periodic rate is 6.0% and index with margin is 8.0%
- Constant payment mortgage has:
  - Constant monthly payments and a fixed interest rate.
- There always will be negative amortization of a mortgage loan if the amount
  paid by a borrower is:
  - Less than the monthly accrued interest
- If the loan to value ratio is 75%, the stated annual interest rate is 5%, the
  loan term is 30 years fully amortizing, and the down payment is \$600,000,
  what is the purchase price of the property?
  - \$2.4 million
- **FOR LOANS:** A point is just a percent.
- For a retail property:
  - Cost is \$4,000,000
  - Gross rent and other income: \$400,000
  - Operating expenses: \$100,000
  - Annual tax depreciation: \$120,000
  - Assumable interest-only mortgage: \$2,000,000 at 5% per year
  - **Acquisition Cap Rate:** 7.5%
  - **Before-tax Cash Flow:** \$200,000 (due to mortgage payments)
  - **Taxable Income:** \$80,000
- CPI, percent rent, and triple net clauses can all increase base rent amount
- What is the `DSCR` for a \$2.5 million property generating a 7.5% before tax
  annual return on equity with a \$1.5 million ten-year interest-only first
  mortgage loan at a 5% annual interest rate?
  - 2.0
    - \$75,000 annual interest-only payment
    - \$75,000 annual profit on the \$1,000,000 equity
      - Means that there was \$150,000 net operating income (`NOI`)
- A lender’s policy of title insurance insures:
  - That any insured title claim against the property will be covered up to the
    loan amount

## Disposition / Renovation of Income Properties

- **Exit Strategies**
  - To realize the increased **equity** value created from an appreciated
    **property**, an owner may **sell**, **exchange**, or **refinance** the
    **property**.
- **Hold/Sell Analysis**
  - Analyze the **marginal rate of return** from **holding** the **property**
    for an additional period of **time** as compared to **selling** the
    **property** currently.
- **Property Sale**
  - **Sell** for **cash** and **pay off** all outstanding **debt** and pay all
    federal, state, and local **taxes** on any **capital gain**. See **IRS Form
    1040 and Schedule D**.
- **Installment Sale**
  - **Sell** on an **installment sale** receiving the **sale price** over
    **time** and paying a proportional amount of the **capital gain tax** with
    each **installment** received. The amount of **installment sale income** to
    be reported each year upon which **tax** must be paid is a function of the
    **ratio** between the **"gross profit"** on the **sale** (i.e. **sale price
    minus adjusted tax basis**) divided by the **"contract price"** as defined
    in **IRS Form 6252**. An **installment sale** is a form of **seller
    financing**.
- **Section 1031 Exchange**
  - **Trade** the **property** for **"like kind" property** in a **US Internal
    Revenue Code Section 1031** exchange transaction to **defer** the **taxes**
    on any **capital gain** but with the **exchange property** receiving a
    **substituted tax basis**. **Section 1031** requires that the **exchange
    property** be **identified** within **45 days** of the **prior sale**
    closing date, and the **exchange property** must be **acquired** within
    **180 days** of the **prior sale** closing date. **"Unlike" property**
    received in a **section 1031** transaction is called **"boot"** and is
    subject to **capital gain taxes** on the **sale**. **"Boot"** includes
    **cash**, **personal property**, and any **"unlike" real property** received
    in the transaction. See **IRS Form 8824**.
- **Refinancing**
  - Replacing an existing **loan** with a new **loan**. If you **refinance**
    with a larger **loan**, you will not pay any **tax** on the additional
    **loan proceeds** received in connection with the **refinancing**. If
    **interest rates** have fallen, it might be possible to **refinance** with a
    larger **loan** while reducing the annual **borrowing cost**, but
    **points**, **appraisal fees**, and other **loan costs** must be considered.
- **Renovation**
  - As an alternative to a **sale**, a **1031 exchange**, or a **refinancing**,
    the **property** may be held and **renovated** to increase **rents**,
    increase **occupancy**, and/or reduce **operating costs**, all of which
    should increase the **net operating income** and thereby increase the
    **property value**. But in addition to the estimated **renovation costs**,
    the **time**, **effort**, and **opportunity costs** related to the
    **renovation** must also be carefully considered.

## Financing Corporate Real Estate

- **Lease vs. Own Analysis**
  - Decision factors include: **space** needed (relative to the size of the
    **property**), **time** needed (**short term** or **long term**), **risk**
    from **property ownership**, **control** and **management** of the
    **property**, **maintenance** and **special purpose buildings**, **tax**
    considerations from **depreciation**, impact on the **financial statements**
    (**balance sheet** and **income statement**), access to and **cost of
    capital**.
- **Residual Value**
  - A **property's** projected future **residual value** (aka **"exit value"**)
    may not be an important part of a company's **purchase decision**. Instead
    of acquiring a **property** that it needs to run its business, a company
    could negotiate a **lease** with an **"equity kicker"** or a **purchase
    option** that might provide future value.
- **Corporate Real Estate Financing**
  - The **acquisition** of **property** for **company** use can be **financed**
    with either **mortgage debt** or unsecured **corporate borrowing**.
    **Mortgage debt** will generally be preferred if it is cheaper than the
    company's unsecured **borrowing cost**.
- **"Capital" Lease**
  - Previously, if a **lease term** exceeded 75% of an **asset's** remaining
    economic life, or if the **present value** of future **lease payments** was
    the majority of the **property's `FMV`** at **lease commencement** (90%+),
    or if **property ownership** was likely to be **transferred** to the
    **lessee** upon **lease expiration** (e.g. a **purchase option**
    substantially below **`FMV`**), then the **lease** was treated as a
    **"capital" lease** and was reported for accounting purposes as if part of
    the **asset** was **owned** by the **lessee**.
- **"Finance" vs. "Operating" Lease**
  - Under `ASC 842` of the `FASB` (effective 1-1-22 for private companies), the
    **present value** of all **lease payments** for **leases** over **one year**
    must be **capitalized** and reported on the **balance sheet** as a
    **right-of-use asset** and a **lease liability**, and **lease payments**
    will be reported as an **expense** on the **income statement**. If the
    **lease term** is one year or less, **lease payments** will be only reported
    on the company's **income statement** and not on the **balance sheet**.
- **Sale-Leaseback**
  - A company might **sell** a **property** it owns and simultaneously **lease**
    it back on a **long-term** basis to obtain **cash** while retaining **use**
    of the **property**. The company might negotiate a **repurchase option**
    into the **lease** to give it the possibility to re-acquire that
    **property** in the future. (**Selling** a **property** and **leasing** it
    back in a **sale-leaseback** transaction, with the **lease** written so that
    it would be reported as an **operating lease**, used to be a form of **off
    balance sheet financing** for the company.)
- **"Hidden" Corporate Real Estate Value**
  - Companies are required to report **property values** at the **lower** of
    **depreciated cost** or **market value**. This can lead a publicly traded
    company to become an **acquisition target** when the **market value** of its
    **properties** substantially **exceeds** the reported depreciated **book
    value**.

<!-- Lecture 13 -->

## Financing Project Development

- **Project Development**
  - **Acquiring** a **land site**; **financing** and **construction** of a
    **building** (**office**, **apartments**, **shopping center**,
    **warehouse**, **hotel**, **self storage**, etc.); **leasing** and
    **managing** the **property**; then **selling**, **exchanging**, or
    **refinancing**.
- **Mixed-Use Development**
  - A **combination** of **real estate** uses in a single **project**.
- **Development Decision Factors**
  - Global, national, and local **economic forecast**; **supply** and **demand**
    for space (i.e. **tenant** demand); **competition** from other **current**
    and **planned developments**; **capital markets** (i.e. **financing cost**
    and availability).
- **Project Feasibility**
  - A **feasibility study** should be done to forecast **tenant demand**, **rent
    levels**, **construction costs**, **project timing**, **exit strategies**,
    and future **sales price**, and evaluate the **risks**. Location is always a
    key factor in the analysis.
- **Construction Financing**
  - Covers the **hard costs** and **soft costs** of **construction**.
    **Construction loans** are disbursed in **draws** after **costs** are
    incurred, are typically **recourse** to the **developer**, are usually
    **short term** (maturing after **construction** is expected to be
    completed), and **floating rate** with **construction interest capitalized**
    into the outstanding **loan balance**. **Construction lenders** want a
    **permanent lender** (**"take-out" lender**) in place to pay off and replace
    the **construction loan** when **construction** is completed and various
    **leasing** targets have been achieved. A **stand-by lender** is a
    **permanent lender** who doesn't intend to actually fund their loan.
- **Project Development Issues**
  - Building:
    - Footprint
    - Envelope
    - Façade
    - Stacking plan
  - Traffic mitigation plan
  - Property taxes
  - Permitting:
    - Zoning codes
    - Building codes
- **Permitting**
  - The process of obtaining local **government approvals** (e.g. city planning,
    city council) to **permit** the proposed **development**. The **project**
    must comply with local **zoning codes** and **building codes** (or obtain a
    **variance**) for a **building permit** to be issued. The **permitting**
    process involves **negotiation** with city planners and their staff.
- **Zoning Codes**
  - **Allowable uses**, **maximum floor area ratio (FAR)**, **height
    restrictions**, **minimum lot size**, **minimum parking ratios**, **building
    setbacks**, etc. **Zoning codes** specify what may be **permitted** to be
    built as of right (e.g. **R-1**, **R-2**, **R-3**, **R-4**, **R-5**,
    **C-1**, **C-2**, **C-3**, **M-1**, **M-2**, **M-3**, **A-1**, **A-2**, ...)
    and may include incentive zoning, inclusionary zoning, and/or cumulative
    zoning.
- **Building Codes**
  - Specify the **materials** and approved **methods** for **construction**.
    City staff must approve the **architectural** and **engineering designs**
    and **specifications** for the **project**, including the **site plan**,
    **elevations**, and **project renderings**. **Code compliance** is enforced
    by city inspectors during **construction** before a **certificate of
    occupancy** (**"C of O"**) will be issued by the local authority after
    **project completion** in compliance with all **building codes** and
    **zoning codes**.

<!-- Lecture 14 -->

## Financing Land Development

- **Land Development**
  - A highly **fragmented**, **competitive**, and **local** business.
- **Land Acquisition**
  - **Option agreements** are often used to give **time** to the **land
    developer** to pursue the **entitlement process**. Periodic **option
    payments** can be made over an extended time frame (monthly, quarterly,
    annually), and if the **developer** ultimately exercises the **option**, the
    **option price** for the **land** will be paid at the closing of the **land
    acquisition**.
- **Zoning and Land Use**
  - City or county **land use plans** specify the allowed uses for each **land**
    parcel (e.g. **residential**, **commercial**, **industrial**,
    **agricultural**, **special purpose**, ...) with subcategories for allowed
    density of use (e.g. **R-1**, **R-2**, **R-3**, **R-4**, **R-5**, **C-1**,
    **C-2**, **C-3**, **M-1**, **M-2**, **M-3**, **A-1**, **A-2**, ...). The
    **local land use** plan is usually updated every 5-10 years, and the local
    **zoning code** can be revised, in whole or in part, whenever necessary.
- **Entitlement Process**
  - The process by which the **land developer** applies to the local authorities
    to convert **unentitled land** to **land** that is **entitled** to be
    **subdivided** and **developed** fora particular purpose and size
    (**office**, **apartments**, **shopping center**, **warehouse**, **hotel**,
    etc.). **Developing** a project that is inconsistent with the local **zoning
    code** and **land use plan** requires a **variance** from the local
    **planning authorities**.
- **Land Financing**
  - Difficult to obtain, **low `LTV`s**, generally **recourse** to the
    **borrower**, and with **tight conditions** from the **lender** to assure
    **repayment**.
- **Release Schedule**
  - The **time** frame within which the **lender** expects the individual **land
    parcels** in a **land development project** to be **sold** according to
    **release prices** agreed to in the **land loan** documents so that the
    **loan** will be **repaid**.
- **Release Prices**
  - The pre-agreed **minimum prices** at which the **developer** can **sell**
    individual **land parcels** and obtain the **lender's release** from its
    blanket **mortgage lien** for the **land** parcels **sold**.
- **On-site Improvements**
  - Land grading, internal paving, private streets, lighting, landscaping, etc.
- **Off-site Improvements**
  - Public roads, street lighting, traffic lights, sewer line extensions, parks
    and schools, etc.

<!-- Lecture 15 -->

## Structuring Real Estate Investments

- **Organizational Forms**
  - To **minimize taxes**, **limit liability**, and define **management** roles
    and responsibilities in **investments**. **Partnerships**, **limited
    liability companies** (**LLCs**), and **real estate investment trusts**
    (**`REIT`s**), are the primary **legal entities** used for structuring the
    **acquisition** and **ownership** of **real estate investments**.
- **Pass-Through Entities**
  - **Pass-through entities** do not pay **taxes** directly but instead pass on
    their **taxable income** or **loss** to the **partners**, **members**, or
    **shareholders** in those **entities** who must report their allocable share
    of the **taxable income** or **loss**.
- **Partnerships**
  - Can be either a **general partnership** or a **limited partnership**. All
    **partnerships** are **pass-through entities** for **tax** purposes and have
    a **finite life**. **Title** to **property** owned by a **partnership** will
    be in the name of the **partnership**. In a **general partnership**, each
    **general partner (GP)** has **decision-making authority** and **unlimited
    liability**. A **limited partnership** must have at least one **general
    partner**, who will have **decision-making authority** and **unlimited
    liability**, and any number of **limited partners (LPs)**, with no
    **decision-making authority** and whose **liability** is generally
    **limited** to the amount of their **investment**. **Partnership interests**
    are **personal property** and so are not eligible for a **Section 1031
    Exchange**. A **partnership agreement** governs the rights and
    responsibilities of the **partners**.
- **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**
  - In 1988, the IRS approved the **limited liability company** structure. In
    1994, California became toe forty-sixth state to enact an **LLC** law. **LLC
    investors** are called **members**, and all **members** have **limited
    liability**. In California, only one **member** is needed to form an
    **LLC**, and **LLCs** have **unlimited life**. **LLCs** are managed by a
    **managing member** or a third party, can elect **pass-through** status for
    **tax** purposes, and are governed by an **operating agreement**.
  - Invented by Wyoming, then the legislature to allow LLCs spread like wildfire
    through all other states
  - California eventually created the holy grail of entities, allowing LLCs to
    be created solo (without even a partner)
- **Limited Liability Partnership (`LLP`)**
  - In California, only professional organizations can be **`LLP`s** (law firms,
    etc.), so an **`LLP`** cannot be used for **real estate investments**.
- **Corporations**
  - **Legal entities** owned by **shareholders** (individuals or other legal
    entities), managed by a **board of directors** in accordance with their
    **articles of incorporation** and **bylaws**, and have **unlimited life**.
    **Dual taxation** (**corporate** and **shareholder** levels) makes **"C"
    corporations** unattractive for **property investments**. **"S"
    corporations** have **shareholder** restrictions but can elect
    **pass-through** status.
- **Joint Venture**
  - In the U.S., not a **legal entity** but rather an **agreement** between at
    least two parties to pursue a specific investment objective. **Joint
    ventures** will typically involve a **partnership**, **limited liability
    company**, **corporation**, or other **legal entity**.
- **Syndication**
  - Not a **legal entity** but a means of **financing investments** by offering
    **limited partnership** or **LLC member interest** in proposed or existing
    **project**.
- **Capital Amount**
  - **Accounting** of an **investor's share** in the **net worth** of an
    **entity**.

<!-- Lecture 16 -->

## The Secondary Mortgage Market

- **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac**
  - The **Federal National Mortgage Association** ("**Fannie Mae**", created in
    1938 and privatized in 1968) and the **Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation** ("**Freddie Mac**", created by the Emergency Home Finance Act
    of 1970) are the largest buyers of **home loans** in the United States.
    Together, they buy almost half of all residential home loans. **Fannie Mae**
    and **Freddie Mac** are huge, NYSE listed companies with \$8 trillion of
    mortgage loans and securities. During the global financial crisis of
    2007-2009, **Fannie Mae** and **Freddie Mac** nearly went bankrupt and were
    placed under the conservatorship of **Federal Housing Finance Agency**
    ("**`FHFA`**", created by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008).
- **Ginnie Mae**
  - **Government National Mortgage Association** ("**Ginnie Mae**", created by
    the HUD Act of 1968) is a wholly owned US government corporation within the
    **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)**. **Ginnie Mae**
    guarantees **Mortgage Backed Securities**.
- **Conforming Loans**
  - **Mortgage loans** that **conform** to **Fannie Mae** and **Freddie Mac
    underwriting guidelines** for **loan size** (for 2023: \$766,550 and
    \$1,149,825 in high cost counties (1.5 times)), **creditworthiness**
    (**`FICO`** score), **`DSCR`**, **`LTV`**, and other criteria.
- **Non-Conforming Loans**
  - **Mortgage loans** that **do not conform** to all the **underwriting
    guidelines** of **Fannie Mae** and **Freddie Mac** at a particular time.
- **Subprime Loans**
  - **Mortgage loans** that fall below the **underwriting guidelines** for
    **creditworthiness** (**`FICO`** score), **`DSCR`**, and/or **`LTV`**. Not
    related to **loan size**.
- **Seasoned Mortgages**
  - **Mortgage loans** that have been paying monthly **principal** and
    **interest** on time. The longer the payments stay current, the more
    "**seasoned**" the **mortgage**.
- **Residential Mortgage Backed Securities ("`RMBS`") and Commercial Mortgage
  Backed Securities ("`CMBS`")**
  - Created when pools of **residential** or **commercial mortgage loans** are
    **tranched** into **securities** for sale to other **investors** in the
    **capital markets**. The primary **risks** associated with these
    **securities** are **default risk** and **prepayment risk**.
- **Default Risk**
  - When the **default rate** on the pool of **mortgage loans** underlying the
    **mortgage backed securities** is higher than was projected at the time of
    the `MBS` offering.
- **Prepayment Risk**
  - When the **prepayment rate** on the pool of **mortgage loans** underlying
    the **mortgage backed securities** is higher than was projected at the time
    of the `MBS` offering.
- **Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ("`CMO`s")**
  - **Debt securities** that are issued using a pool of **mortgage loans** as
    **collateral**, where the **issuer** retains **ownership** of the **loans**.
- **Collateralized Debt Obligations ("`CDO`s")**
  - Any **debt** can be **collateral** for the **securities**.
- **Principal Only Tranches ("`PO`s"), Interest Only Tranches ("`IO`s"),
  Floaters, and Inverse Floaters**
  - Some of the unique **securities** that can be created to appeal to different
    **investors**.

<!-- Lecture 17 -->

## Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

- **REIT Structure**
  - The **REIT** structure was created by the US Congress in 1960 to allow small
    investors to participate in the **property markets** without paying a
    **corporate tax**. **REITs** provide **liquidity**, **dividends**,
    **diversification**, and **professional management**. If all **REIT rules**
    are met, a **REIT** will not pay **tax** at the **entity** level, **REIT
    dividends** will be **taxed** to the **REIT's shareholders**, but **REIT
    losses** will not be passed through to the **shareholders**.
- **Types of REITs**
  - Most **REITs** are **equity REITs** (basically, a property REIT) that
    primarily own **properties**, and the rest are **mortgage REITs** that
    primarily own **mortgage debt** and **`MBS`**. Most **equity REITs** focus
    on a single **property** type (**office**, **retail**, **apartments**,
    **industrial**, **hotels**, **self-storage**, etc.). **Mortgage REITs**
    focus on either **residential mortgages** or **commercial mortgages**.
- **REIT Qualifications**
  - **REITs** must be managed by a **board of directors**, must have at least
    **100 shareholders**, not more than 50% of a **REIT's** shares can be held
    by five or fewer **shareholders** (**"5/50" Rule**), **shares** must be
    **fully transferable**, can be **public** or **private**.
- **Distribution Requirements**
  - At least **90%** of a **REIT's taxable income** must be distributed as
    **dividends** to the **REIT's shareholders**, otherwise the **REIT** will
    pay **corporate tax**. (Typically they always pay 100%, so the last 10%
    isn't taxed at the corporate level).
- **Asset Requirements**
  - At least **75%** of a **REIT's assets** must be related to **real estate**,
    government securities or cash, and not more than **20%** of a **REIT's
    assets** can be **taxable REIT subsidiaries** (`TRS`s were authorized by the
    **1999 REIT Modernization Act**).
- **Income Requirements**
  - At least **95%** of a **REIT's gross income** must be from **real estate
    rents**, **profits** from **asset sales**, **mortgage interest** income, and
    **REIT dividends** received.
- **Net Asset Value (`NAV`)**
  - **Net Asset Value** is an accounting measure of a **REIT's net worth**,
    which may or may not accurate reflect its current **market value** if the
    **REIT's assets** have increased or decreased in value relative to their
    **depreciated cost**. If a **REIT's stock price** reflects its **`NAV`**
    more than its true **market value**, the **REIT** may be a takeover
    candidate.
- **Funds from Operations (`FFO`)**
  - **REIT income** is measured as "**funds from operations**", which is
    **earnings per share (`EPS`)** adjusted by adding back **depreciation** and
    excluding any **profits** or **losses** from **asset sales**, and is a
    measure of its **dividend** paying ability.
- **`UPREIT`s**
  - **Umbrella Partnership REITs** issue **operating partnership units (OP
    units)** that are **convertible** into **REIT shares** and allow a **REIT**
    to buy **appreciated properties** with **OP units** instead of cash so
    **sellers** of the **properties** can achieve a **Section 1031** tax
    deferred exchange. When **OP units** are converted into **REIT shares**,
    **capital gain taxes** will be due.
- **REIT Growth Drivers**
  - **REITs** can:
    1. Increase the **net operating income** from their existing **properties**
       by increasing **rents** and **occupancy levels**
    2. **Acquire** additional **properties**
    3. **Renovate** or **expand** existing **properties** or **develop** new
       **properties** on excess **land**
    4. Provide **property services** through **taxable REIT subsidiaries**
       (**leasing** or **property management**)
    5. **Financial engineering** (**property debt** or **REIT corporate
       leverage**)
- **{MISC}**
  - Apartments appreciate at 27.5 years, all other properties at 39 years
