<!-- Lecture 1 -->

Current market supply is low because many homeowners purchased homes at a very
low interest rate, and are reluctant to sell.

## Basic Legal Concepts

- **Real Estate:** Land and all things permanently attached to it.
- **Real Property:** Ownership rights associated with real estate.
- **Personal Property:** Movable things and intangibles.
- **Fixtures:** Personal property. Once attached to a building, they become a
  part of the real property.
- **Statute of Frauds:** Requires that almost every agreement relating to real
  property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law.
- **Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate:** Ownership, possessory, and use
  rights.
- **Easement:** A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land
  owned or leased by someone else. They are very limited in nature.
- **Leasehold Estate / Lease:** Real property can be leased by the landlord /
  lessor to the tenant / lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period
  of time. Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the
  Statute of Frauds.
- **Title:** Determines ownership of the real property and is evidenced by a
  deed.
- **Security Interests:** A borrower signs a mortgage (or a deed of trust) as
  the mortgage (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or
  beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the
  repayment of a loan.
- **Recording Act:** All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of
  claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of
  recorded items.
- **Abstract of Title:** Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents
  that affect title to real property.
- **Title Insurance:** Method of assuring title to real property used in
  California and all other states. Two kinds: Owner's Policy and Lender's Policy
  (can be `CLTA` or `ALTA`).
- **Mechanic's Lien:** May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and
  materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in
  California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the
  materials are supplied.

## Notes and Mortgages

- **Promissory Note**
  - Documents a **loan** between a **borrower** and a **lender**. Must include
    the **parties**, **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **maturity date**.
    Usually includes clauses relating to **amortization**, **assumability** or
    **"due on sale"**, **recourse** or **non-recourse,** **repayment** or
    **lockout**, **assignment**, **default**, and **acceleration.**
- **Mortgage**
  - A two-party **security interest** in **real property** to secure the
    repayment of a **real estate loan** that is given by a **borrower /
    mortgagor** to a **lender / mortgagee**.
- **Deed of Trust**
  - A three-party **security interest** in **real property** that is given by a
    **borrower / trustor** to an independent **trustee** to secure the repayment
    of a **real estate loan** for the benefit of a **lender / beneficiary**.
    Used in California and mos other states where it is available, because it is
    preferred over a two-party **mortgage**.
- **Senior vs. Junior Mortgage**:
  - Determined by state **recording** statues that determine lender **priority**
    (unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a **subordination clause**).
- **Purchase money loan**
  - A **loan** made to a **borrower** to purchase **real estate**.
- **Construction loan**
  - A **loan** for the **construction** of a **building** or **improvements**.
    **Loan** draws are made against a **maximum loan amount**, are secured by a
    **mortgage** or **deed of trust** against the **real property**, usually
    with **recourse** to the developer.
    - _**NOTE! Avoid lockout**_, always go for prepayment penalty (ideally no
      lockout and no prepayment penalty).
- **Default**
  - Failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the **loan** or
    **mortgage**. The most common **mortgage default** is the failure to pay
    **interest** and **principal** when due. **Default** can lead to
    **acceleration** of the **loan** and **foreclosure** of the **property**.
- **Foreclosure**
  - With a deed of trust, can be **judicial** (in court) or **non-judicial**
    (out of court) and involves a **lender** ultimately taking **title** to
    **real property** or forcing **sale** of the **property** to satisfy the
    unpaid **mortgage** balance. All **junior mortgages** are extinguished when
    a **senior mortgage lender** forecloses on a **property**, but the **debt**
    secured by those **junior mortgages** is generally unaffected by the
    foreclosure.
- **Deficiency Judgement**
  - Any **loan balance** remaining after a **judicial foreclosure sale** can
    become a **personal judgement** against the **borrower** if the loan is
    **recourse**. California law generally protects homeowners from a
    **deficiency judgement**.
- **Workouts and Extension Agreements**
  - Are usually preferred by **lenders** over **foreclosure**, and involve
    **negotiations** with the **borrower** to extend the **maturity date**, to
    increase the **amortization period**, or to temporarily reduce the
    **mortgage payments**, rather than permanently lowering the **interest
    rate** or reducing the **loan balance**.
- **Short Sale**
  - When a **lender** allows the **sale** of a **property** for less than the
    outstanding **loan balance**, typically without requiring the **borrower**
    to pay the shortfall.
- **Bankruptcy**
  - **Chapter 7** (liquidation) and **Chapter 11** (reorganization of a
    business)

<!-- Lecture 3 -->

## Time Value of Money

- **Compounding Interest**
  - $(1+i)^{n}$ where $i$ is the periodic **interest rate** and $n$ is the
    number of **compounded periods**.
- **Compounding**
  - Approach to taking a **present value** to a **future value**.
    - $\text{Future Value (FV)} = \text{Present Value}\cdot (1+i)^{n}$
- **Discounting**
  - Approach to taking a **future value** back to a **present value**.
    - $\text{Present Value (PV)} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1+i)^{n}}$
- **Annuities (PMT)**
  - **Investments** with constant future **periodic payments**.
- **Interest Rate (i), Effective Yield, Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
  - Various measures of the return on capital or the cost of capital.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**
  - The **present value** of all **projected future cash flows** discounted at a
    specific **discount rate**, less the cost of the **investment**.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
  - The calculated **discount rate** at which the **present value** of all
    **projected future cash flows** is equal to the cost of the **investment**.
- **Risk**
  - Is essential to evaluate in order to determine whether the expected
    **investment return** is sufficient in light of the perceived **risk**.

## Fixed Interest Rate Mortgage Loans

- **Capital Markets**
  - **Financial** and **securities markets**, including the **mortgage market**.
- **Loan Availability**
  - **Economic growth** prospects (global, national, and local), expected
    **inflation**, and other **risks** all affect the supply and cost of
    **mortgage** funds.
- **Lenders as Intermediaries**
  - Most **real estate lenders** sell the **loans** they **originate** into the
    **secondary mortgage market** rather than holding the **loans** to
    **maturity**.
- **Loan Pricing**
  - The **interest rate**, any **fees**, **points**, and **costs** charged by
    the **lender**, and the **loan terms** (including any **prepayment
    penalties**).
    - **Points** are a percent of the loan amount you can pay upfront in
      exchange for paying less interest over time.
- **Real Interest Rate**
  - The nominal or contract **interest rate** minus expected **inflation**.
- **Risk Adjusted Return**
  - Expected investment **return** relative to the perceived **risk**.
- **Amortization:** The process of **repaying** the **principal balance** of a
  **loan** over time.
- **Balloon Payment** <!-- Lecture 4 -->
  - The **principal balance** of the **loan** due on the **maturity date**.
- **Pay Rate vs. Accrual Rate**
  - Is the actual monthly mortgage **payment** that is made by a **borrower** at
    least equal to the **accrued interest** amount then due on the **loan**?
- **Constant Payment Mortgage**
  - When each monthly **payment** is the same, the **loan** will be **fully
    amortizing**, **partially amortizing**, **interest only**, or **negative
    amortizing**.
- **Constant Amortization Mortgage**
  - When each **payment** includes a fixed amount of **principal** repayment,
    with the monthly **payment** and **interest** amounts declining.
- **Reverse Annuity Mortgage**
  - The **lender** sends fixed monthly checks to the **borrower** who must pay
    the accumulated **principal** and accrued **interest** on the **maturity
    date**.
- **Loan Fees and Costs**
  - **Origination fees** (for loan underwriting and processing), **appraisal**
    and **credit report**. **Loan fees** and **points** increase the **lender's
    yield**.
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**
  - Provides **disclosure** regarding the effects of **loan fees**, **points**,
    and **costs** on **residential loans** (assumes the **loan** is held to
    **maturity**).
- **Truth-in-Lending Act**
  - **Federal Reserve Regulation Z** requires **lenders** to include in **APR**
    calculations all **loan fees**, **points**, and **costs**, but not any
    **prepayment penalties**.
- **Prepayment Penalties**
  - Increase the **effective yield** to the **lender**, are subject to
    **negotiation**, and are not reflected in the **APR** of a loan. If a
    **prepayment penalty** is paid, the **effective yield** to the **lender**
    will be higher if the **loan** is repaid earlier.
- **Effective Annual Interest Rate**
  - **Calculation** that considers all **loan fees**, **points**, and **costs**
    and any **prepayment penalties** actually paid, and is therefore affected by
    the amount of **time** the **loan** is held until **repayment**.

<!-- Lecture 5 -->

## Adjustable / Floating Rate Mortgage Loans

- **Interest Rates Changes**
  - **Indexed** to other market **interest rates** (plus a **margin**).
- **Index**
  - **SOFT** (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is replacing **LIBOR** (London
    Interbank Offered Rate), **US Treasuries**, **COFI** (eleventh district Cost
    of Funds Index), **Prime**. The **index** can be overnight, six months, one
    year, or another interest rate series.
- **Margin**
  - **Lender's profit margin** or spread (fixed for the loan term) over the
    index.
- **Composite Rate**
  - The **index + margin** is the **composite interest rate** on the **loan**.
- **Reset Dates**
  - When the **interest rate changes** (usually every six months or one year).
- **Caps and Floors**
  - **Caps** are the **maximum** and **floors** are the **minimum** allowed for
    **periodic** and/or **lifetime** adjustments of the **interest rate** or
    **loan payment** amount.
- **Loan Terms**
  - Are generally the same terms as with the **fixed rate loans**, other than
    the interest rate changes, and include **assumable** or "**due on sale**",
    **recourse** or **non-recourse,** **prepayment** or **lockout,**
    **assignment,** **default,** and **acceleration.**
- **Loan Fees and Costs**
  - As with **fixed rate loans**, **origination fees**, **points**, and
    **costs** may be charged to the **borrower** to increase the **effective
    yield** to the **lender**.
- **Interest Only or Amortizing**
  - As with **fixed rate loans**, **ARMs** are usually **fully amortizing**, but
    can also be written as **interest only** or **partially amortizing**.
- **Negative Amortization**
  - If the **loan payment** required is less than the amount of **accrued
    interest** then due on the **loan** because of a **payment cap**, there will
    be **negative amortization**. **Interest rate caps** do not cause **negative
    amortization**.
- **Teaser Rate**
  - Initial **interest rate** on the **loan**, often far below the **composite
    rate**.
- **Payment Shock**
  - When the **interest rate** fully adjusts to the current **composite rate**,
    the new **loan payment** amount is often substantially higher than the
    **teaser rate**.
- **Interest Rate Risk**
  - Because **ARM interest rates** adjust **periodically**, **interest rate
    risk** is higher for the **borrower** and lower for the **lender**. The
    shorter the time interval between **reset dates**, the higher the **risk**
    for the **borrower** and lower for the **lender**.
- **Default Risk**
  - Because the **interest rate** adjusts **periodically**, the potential for
    future **rate** increases elevates the **risk** of a **default** by the
    **borrower** leading to **foreclosure**.
- **Hybrid ARMs**
  - **3/1**, **5/1**, **7/1**, or **10/1** are **fixed rate loans** for the
    first 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, then become **adjustable rate loans** with
    annual **interest rate reset dates**.
- **Conversion Option**
  - The right of the **borrower** to convert the **loan** from an **ARM** to a
    **fixed rate loan** at a specified future date, usually with a **fee** paid
    to the **lender**.

## Mortgages: Additional Concepts

- **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)**
  - **Mortgage debt** divided by **property value** (or **price**).
- **Market Value of a Loan**
  - The **present value** of all expected future **loan payments** (i.e. all
    expected future payments of **principal** and **interest**).
- **Incremental Borrowing Cost**
  - The **marginal cost** of the additional amount **borrowed**, taking into
    consideration the **interest rate** and other **loan fees**, **points**, and
    **costs**.
- **Home Equity Line of Credit**
  - A **Home Equity Line of Credit** (`HELOC`) can be secured by a **first**,
    **second**, or more **junior mortgage** and is typically a revolving **line
    of credit**.
- **Buydown Loans**
  - When a **seller** pays a **fee** to a third-party **lender** to buy down the
    **interest rate** on a **purchase money loan** to induce the
    **buyer/borrower** to acquire the **real property**. The amount paid to buy
    down the **interest rate** will be much less than the **present value** of
    the reduced **loan payments** from the lower **interest rate**.
- **Below Market Seller Financing**
  - When the pricing of the **seller financing** (**interest rate** and **loan
    fees**, **points**, and **costs**) is less than the **market** pricing of
    available **financing**, often to improve the **sale price** of a
    **property** by a motivated **seller**.
- **Wraparound Loans**
  - Might be used by a **seller** in a slow housing market and when the
    **buyer** has poor credit to help sell a **property**. The **first
    mortgage** must stay in place, so it does not work if there is a **"due on
    sale"** clause in the **loan agreement**.

<!-- Lecture 6 -->

## Income Producing Properties - Leases

- **Commercial Properties**
  - Office, retail, apartment, industrial, hotel, mixed-use, ...
- **Supply and Demand Analysis**
  - Important for the **valuation** of **properties** and the projection of
    future **rent** and **occupancy** levels. **Global**, **national**,
    **regional**, and **local** factors affect the **value** of **properties**
    and **rent levels** for **commercial** space.
- **Location**
  - The most important factor in **real estate** because it is **location**
    specific.
- **Occupancy / Vacancy**
  - **Occupancy = 100% - Vacancy**. Driven by many factors, including **supply
    and demand**, **location**, **quality** (age, design, construction, etc.).
- **Lease Terms**
  - The parties (landlord/tenant or lessor/lessee), premises, term, base rent,
    CPI increases, or percentage rent, security deposit and/or guarantors,
    allowable uses, insurance, repairs and maintenance, damage or destruction,
    property taxes and other expenses, assignment and subletting, defaults and
    remedies, subordination, attornment and non-disturbance, signage, right of
    first refusal or expansion option on adjacent space, notices, governing law.
- **Rental Income**
  - **Flat base rent**, **step-up rent**, **CPI** or **indexed rent** with
    **caps and floors**, **percentage rent** with **overage rent** above a sales
    amount **breakpoint**.
- **Concessions**
  - **Free rent**, reduced **rent**, **tenant improvement** allowance (**TI**).
- **Property Expenses**
  - Gross leases (tenant pays no expenses), modified gross leases (e.g.
    electricity), triple net leases (tenant pays all operating expenses
    including property taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and
    utilities).
- **Expense Stop**
  - **Property expenses** per **rentable square foot** up to the **expense
    stop** will be paid by the **landlord** with **expenses** over that amount
    paid by the **tenant**.
- **Rentable vs. Usable Square Feet**
  - **Rentable square footage** is **usable square footage** plus the
    **tenant's** pro rata share of **building common areas** (including public
    areas, shared hallways, shared restrooms, public stairwells, elevator
    lobbies).
- **Load Factor**
  - **Rentable area** divided by **usable area** (a lower ratio is more
    efficient).
- **Parking**
  - Specific **parking spaces** can be assigned to a **tenant** or per thousand
    square feet of rented space. **Parking charges** can be added to the
    **rent** or included.
- **Office Leases**
  - Anchor tenants, signage, parking, expansion option, purchase option or right
    of first refusal, overloading, gross or net or expense stops.
- **Retail Leases**
  - **Anchor tenants**, **signage**, **parking**, **co-tenancy** clause,
    **exclusivity**, **radius** clause, **termination** or **kick-out** rights,
    **operating times**, and **CAM** charges.

<!-- Lecture 7 -->

**NOTE:** Borrowers always want loans to be non-recourse.

## Valuation of Income Properties/Appraisal

- **Market Value**
  - The **price** at which a willing **buyer** and a willing **seller**, each
    without undue pressure, would **buy** and **sell** a particular
    **property**, as of a particular **date**.
- **Appraised Value**
  - An estimate or **opinion** of **property value**, for a particular
    **purpose** as of a particular **date**, by a particular **appraiser**. The
    three primary appraisal methods are: **sales comparison**, **capitalization
    of income**, and **replacement cost**. Each of the three **appraisal
    methods** should, in theory, produce an similar **valuation**.
- **Sales Comparison (or Comparable Sales)**
  - Compares recent **sales** of highly **comparable properties** that are
    similar in **location**, **size**, **age**, **construction quality**, and
    other factors. This is generally the only method used for **residential
    properties**, and one of the three methods used to appraise **commercial
    properties**.
- **Capitalization of Income**
  - **Gross rent multiplier**, **capitalization** of **net operating income**,
    and **discounted present value (`DCF`)** of projected future annual
    **`NOI`**.
- **Gross Rent Multiplier**
  - **Annual rental income x gross rent multiplier = price** (or **value**). The
    **gross rent multiplier** must be derived from the **`GRM`s** on **sales**
    of **comparable properties**. This simple method is often used for valuing
    **apartments**.
- **Capitalization of `NOI`**
  - $\text{Cap Rate} = \text{NOI} \div \text{Price}$, so $\text{NOI} \div
    \text{Cap Rate} = \text{Price (or value)}$, and $\text{Cap Rate} \times
    \text{Price} = \text{NOI}$. The **capitalization rate** (aka **cap rate**)
    is derived from recent **sales** of **comparable properties** and is
    affected by **market** conditions. Falling **interest rates** will tend to
    lower **cap rates**, while rising **interest rates** will increase **cap
    rates**. An increase in **demand** relative to **supply** in the local
    **market** will lower **cap rates**, while an increase in **supply**
    relative to **demand** will raise **cap rates**.
- **Discounted Present Value (`DCF`)**
  - A 10-year cash flow model is typically created. The **discount rate** used
    (or required **internal rate of return**) is based on the buyer's assessment
    of the **risk** of achieving the projected future **`NOI`** and the
    projected future **sale price** relative to current alternative
    **investments** and **capital market** benchmarks.
- **Replacement Cost**
  - The sum of **land value** and **depreciated replacement cost** of the
    **improvements**. **Depreciation** of the **building** can come from
    **physical depreciation**, **functional obsolescence**, and **external
    obsolescence**. The **land value** is derived from a **comparable sales**
    analysis of similar **land** parcels. The **replacement cost** approach is
    more reliable when the **improvements** are relatively new.
- **Land Value**
  - A "**highest and best use**" analysis to determine the **value** of a
    particular **land** site, whether the **land** is **vacant** or
    **improved**. A particular **land** parcel might actually be worth more if
    the existing **improvements** are demolished and removed.

<!-- Lecture 8 -->

## Investment Analysis and Taxation of Income Properties

- **Investment Benefits**
  - **Cash flow** (after **taxes**), **price appreciation**,
    **diversification**.
- **Real Estate Cycle**
  - The **real estate** industry is **cyclical**, with periods of **growth** and
    periods of **decline** in **rents**, **occupancy**, and **property values**.
    The industry is very large and highly competitive, with many owners and
    limited concentration of ownership.
- **Investment Strategies**
  - **Risk/return** focus (**core**, **value-added**, or **opportunistic**),
    **property type** (e.g. **office**, **retail**, **apartments**, **hotels**),
    and/or **geographical** focus.
- **Market Analysis**
  - **Supply/demand** analysis for **property type** and **local market**, and
    local **absorption** projects to forecast future **occupancy rates** and
    **rent levels**.
- **Net Operating Income (`NOI`)**
  - **Rent** and other **property income** minus **operating expenses**.
    **`NOI`** is often **capitalized** to determine the **market value** of a
    **property**.
- **Leverage**
  - The use of **debt** to acquire or own **property**.
- **Loan to Value Ratio (`LTV`)**
  - **Mortgage balance** divided by **property value** (or **price**).
- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (`DSCR`)**
  - Annual **`NOI`** divided by **mortgage payments**. A higher **`DSCR`** shows
    a greater ability for the **borrower** to make **mortgage payments**.
- **Before Tax Cash Flow**
  - **`NOI`** minus **debt service** and **capital expenditures** (cap ex).
- **After Tax Cash Flow**
  - **Before tax cash flow** minus **taxes**. The **government** is your partner
    in every **investment** through its power to **tax** the annual **income**
    and **capital gains** from **sale**. **Federal**, **state**, **local**, and
    all other **taxes** must be considered.
- **Taxable Income**
  - **Net operating income** minus **interest** and **tax depreciation**.
- **Tax Depreciation**
  - The amount of the **purchase price** allocated to the **improvements**,
    exclusive of the **land**, is the **depreciable cost basis** of the
    **property**. The **depreciable cost basis** can be **amortized** as **tax
    depreciation** over **27.5 years** for **residential income properties** and
    **39 years** for **non-residential income properties**.
- **Mortgage Interest Deduction**
  - The **interest** portion of the monthly **P&I Payments** is fully **tax
    deductible** for **investment properties**. Limited for primary and
    secondary **homes** to the annual **interest** on a total of up to
    **\$750,000 of mortgage debt**.
- **Unleveraged Returns vs. Leveraged Returns**
  - The `IRR`, ROE, and Equity Multiple due to mortgage financing. The leveraged
    returns should generally be higher than the unleveraged returns to account
    for the additional risk from the use of leverage.
